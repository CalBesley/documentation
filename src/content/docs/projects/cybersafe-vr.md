## What is CyberSafe VR

Many owners or employees within these businesses may have theoretical knowledge of cyber security (some may not) but lack a practical understanding of its application and how to safeguard their businesses against cyber threats.


Proposal: This project addresses this gap by creating interactive VR modules focused on fundamental cyber security training. These modules will cover crucial topics such as password security, data encryption, Wi-Fi and network security, safe web browsing, and common cyber-attacks like phishing and SMiShing. For instance, users might navigate through a virtual office space where they identify and respond to phishing emails or infected USB drives. They will learn to identify suspicious emails, remove viruses, implement accounts with the least privileges, encrypt the backup hard drives, and effectively configure the device or Wi-Fi network security settings, using VPN and install-anti-viruses.
