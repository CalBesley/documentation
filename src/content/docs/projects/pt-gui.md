## What is PT-GUI
The Deakin Detonator Toolkit (DDT) continues to evolve as a pioneering platform designed to simplify the penetration testing process by offering a user-friendly graphical interface that bridges the gap between complex command-line operations and the end-user. This innovative toolkit integrates a comprehensive suite of 40 built-in tools, 5 attack vectors, and 12 walkthroughs, aiming to enhance the educational journey of novice developers and cybersecurity enthusiasts. The focus for this trimester is on refining and standardizing the existing tools to ensure they perform optimally, with a temporary pause on integrating new tools to prioritize quality and functionality improvements.


The DDT team has established a specialized testing team to rigorously evaluate all future code submissions, ensuring that each tool within the toolkit meets the high standards expected by Hardhat Enterprises. This approach underscores DDT's commitment to delivering a robust and reliable penetration testing utility. The immediate goal is to fix and enhance the functionality of 30 out of the 40 tools by the end of the trimester, with plans to release an updated version of DDT that incorporates these improvements.


Long-term deliverables include the implementation of a unified coding framework to facilitate easier contributions from junior developers and streamline the code review process. Automated testing will be introduced to enhance efficiency and maintain high-quality standards, culminating in a Test Closure Report that will summarize the testing journey and offer insights for future projects. This strategic focus on enhancing existing tools, coupled with a comprehensive testing and standardization plan, positions DDT as a cornerstone in the educational landscape for aspiring developers and a standard-bearer for penetration testing utilities within Hardhat Enterprises.
