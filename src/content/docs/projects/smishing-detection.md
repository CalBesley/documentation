## What is Smishing Detection

Smishing, a form of phishing attack executed via Short Message Service (SMS), poses a significant threat to mobile users. These malicious messages, especially the highly targeted spear phishing variants, can lead to severe data breaches and financial losses. Typically, attackers leverage leaked personal data, embedding it within messages to capture victims' attention. They then entice these individuals to engage with malicious URLs or contacts, aiming to extract sensitive details like login credentials and financial information.
To combat this growing menace, the Smishing Detection project embarked on creating AI-driven models to discern the legitimacy of SMS messages. The project's cornerstone is a mobile application designed to seamlessly integrate with smartphones, offering real-time identification of potential scam or spam messages. Users are then empowered to decide on the subsequent action â€“ whether to discard or overlook the flagged SMS. The project's journey encompassed:

In-depth research and documentation detailing the modus operandi of both attackers and defenders, grounded in robust threat models.

A thorough exploration and documentation of the latest advancements in smishing detection techniques and methodologies.

The development of sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing models tailored for pinpointing SMS-based threats.
The creation of a user-centric mobile application, serving as the frontline defence against smishing attempts, by offering real-time scam/spam SMS detection and user-guided response mechanisms.
