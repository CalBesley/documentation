## What is Github?

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to work together on projects. It provides features such as code hosting, issue tracking, and pull requests. With GitHub, developers can easily manage and track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.

## How does Hardhat Enterprises Use Github?

At Hardhat Enterprises, we use GitHub as a platform for version control and collaboration. By having a single organisation on GitHub, all users within the organisation have access to all the repositories. This allows for seamless collaboration and sharing of code among team members.

GitHub provides various features that are beneficial for software development projects. These include code hosting, issue tracking, and pull requests. Code hosting allows developers to store and manage their code repositories on GitHub. Issue tracking helps in managing and resolving bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to the project. Pull requests enable developers to propose changes to the codebase and have them reviewed by other team members before merging them into the main codebase.
