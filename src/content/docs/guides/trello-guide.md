## What is Trello?

Trello is a web-based project management tool that allows individuals and teams to organise and track their tasks and projects. It provides a visual interface with boards, lists, and cards, making it easy to create and manage workflows. With Trello, users can collaborate, assign tasks, set due dates, and track progress, making it an effective tool for project planning and organisation.

## How does Hardhat Enterprises Use Trello?

At Hardhat Enterprises, we share a single workspace in Trello. This means that all users have access to all boards within the workspace. 

Our workflow in Trello starts with the Product Owners meeting with the product backlog leads who create features and tasks in the respective project boards called cards. These cards are then further organised into sprints, which help us plan and track our progress. Members of each project will assign themselves to a card and work together as a team to complete them. This enables us to better communicate, coordinate and achieve the project deliverables. Trello also serves as evidence for our portfolios. Ensure that you maintain all work you have completed by making comments and changes to the cards in Trello.

Once you volunteer for a card, we work together to complete them. This collaborative approach allows us to efficiently manage our projects and ensure that everyone is aligned towards the common goal. Cards can be moved around to indicate their status.

Not all projects in Hardhat use Trello in the same way, contact your project lead for more information!
